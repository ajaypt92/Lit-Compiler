# LitCompiler
Graduate project to create a compiler for a simple programming language called "Lit". This repository contains code for the "Lit" compiler. The compiled code reads in source code files with a ".lit" extension, parses and generates byte code for the program, and executes the "Lit" source code commands. The project was part of a graduate-level CS class.
